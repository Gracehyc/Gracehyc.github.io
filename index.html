        <h3> plain text vs. rich text</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plain text is also known as pure text, meaning it doesn't have any formats or markups on the text.</li>
                <li>Rich text basically means text with formats, or markups.</li>
            </ul>
            Additonally, HTML is one way to represent a text file with markups. Markups are used to denote structures of the file. For example, a file can have a header, a body and a foot, and multiple sections inside the body.
